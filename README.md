A **3D city simulation** developed using **OpenGL and C++** as part of an academic **Computer Graphics course**.  
The project demonstrates real-time rendering, animation, traffic logic, environmental effects, and interactive keyboard controls within a simulated urban environment.

## ✨ Features

### 🌇 Environment & Time Simulation
- Day and night mode switching
- Dynamic weather effects:
  - Rainfall
  - Snowfall
- Sky, lighting, and atmosphere changes based on environment state

---

### 🚦 Traffic Light System
- Fully functional traffic lights:
  - 🔴 **Red** – Vehicles stop, pedestrian crossing enabled
  - 🟡 **Yellow** – Transition phase
  - 🟢 **Green** – Vehicles move
- Vehicles respond dynamically to traffic signals
- Pedestrian movement synchronized with traffic lights

---

### 🚗 Vehicles & Pedestrians
- Multiple animated vehicles on the road
- Adjustable vehicle speed via keyboard input
- Pedestrian crossing animation
- Vehicle headlights visible during night mode

---

### 🏙 City Elements
- Buildings (residential, hospital, hotel, institutional)
- Roads, footpaths, street lights, trees
- Water body with ship animation
- Realistic city layout design

## ⌨ Controls & Key Bindings

The simulation is fully interactive and can be controlled using the keyboard.

### 🚗 Vehicle Controls
| Key | Action |
|----|--------|
| **W / Q** | Increase vehicle speed |
| **S** | Decrease vehicle speed |

---

### 🌦 Environment Controls
| Key | Action |
|----|--------|
| **B** | Start rainfall |
| **P** | Start snowfall |
| **D** | Switch to day mode |
| **N** | Switch to night mode |

---

### 🚦 Traffic Light Controls
| Key | Action |
|----|--------|
| **G** | Green light (vehicles move) |
| **Y** | Yellow light (transition state) |
| **R** | Red light (vehicles stop, pedestrian crossing enabled) |
